# Ecommerce Admin Dashboard 

**Ecommerce Admin Dashboard ** is a full-stack web application built with Vue on the frontend and Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose on the backend. It is designed to streamline product management and provide actionable insights for ecommerce businesses. The dashboard includes three key pages: a Product Inventory page for updating stock levels, searching, and filtering products; a Product Registration form to easily add new items to the catalog; and an Analytics tab that leverages Vue Chart.js to visualize business trends through Line, Bar, and Pie charts. The application combines a responsive, component-based UI with a RESTful backend, offering an efficient and scalable solution for ecommerce administration.
